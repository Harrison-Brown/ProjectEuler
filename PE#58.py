Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

--------

After some math, it can be seen that the following equations hold:
Numbers on top-right diagonal:
    4x^2 + 6x + 3
Numbers on top-left diagonal:
    4x^2 + 8x + 5
Numbers on bottom-left diagonal:
    4x^2 + 10x + 7

Found by starting at odd square (2x+1)^2 and adding one more than that to each
    starting. (13 = (2x+1)^2 + 2x + 2)
Other diagonals require another 2x+2 for each jump

---------

-generate list of numbers in each diagonal
-find number of primes in each
-compare against total number of numbers in lists
